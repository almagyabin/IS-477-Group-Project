# **PROJECT PLAN**

## **Overview**
Our Data Management, Curation, and Responsibility project will revolve around databases containing information on anime. Primarily, our data need is explore how popular the anime in the datasets are. We chose to focus on anime specifically because both of us are avid anime watchers and manga readers. Exploring a topic that we have a personal interest in adds an element of fun into an already interesting project. 
  
With our data need and research questions, we plan to develop a project that effectively implements the key topics and modules covered over the duration of this course, including but not limited to: *The Data Lifecycle* [Module One], *Data Collection and Acquisition* [Module Three], *Workflow Automation and Provenance* [Modules Eleven and Twelve] and *Metadata and Data Documentation* [Module Fifteen].

## **Research Questions**
Following up on the Overview section, our research questions are related to our data need. First, we want to ask: 	<ins>What is the most common rating given by users?</ins> We feel like this is an important question to investigate and answer because certain statistics [whether mean, mode, range] can give a general picture of the data and introduce insights and takeaways.

Secondly, we want to know: <ins>Does the rating of the show correlate with how many favorites it has?</ins> To us, this second research question will most likely require more analysis and supplementary visualizations, such as a scatter plot. Both questions can open the door to further examination, such as seeing if shows in similar genres share similar ratings and favorites or if shows with similar ratings debuted in the same year.

## **Team**
This team consists of two members, ***Alma Gyabin*** and ***Obi Obah***. Since there are only the two of us, it will be difficult to ‘assign roles’ as we will most likely be conducting the same research. Therefore, each team member [the both of us] will be responsible for meeting any timeline deadlines, as well as equally contributing to the project as much as possible. 
  
Furthermore, communication inside and outside the classroom is important in order to maintain a constant and efficient workflow. In addition to these basic responsibilities, each team member is responsible for the upkeep of the repository, which includes adding and cleaning files, committing changes, etc. In terms of actual work, each team member will be responsible for collecting data and answering one research question appropriately and according to the project guidelines.

## **Datasets**
The total amount of datasets and their specifics may change throughout the course of this project. If or when that happens, we will update this course project plan with any and all relevant details. The first dataset we will be using is called [**Anime Dataset 2025**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rafidahmed816/anime-dataset-2025). According to Kaggle, *"this dataset contains information about various anime, including their titles, airing details, studios, genres, themes, and popularity metrics. It is useful for tasks like anime recommendation systems, trend analysis."* The dataset was posted by Rafid Ahmed, the only author and collaborator for the dataset. 

The second dataset we will use is also from Kaggle, titled [**Anime Database July 2025**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazzadsiddiquelikhon/myanimelist-anime-database-july-2025/data). According to the context provided on the website, *“this dataset represents a comprehensive snapshot of the MyAnimeList.net database as of July 16, 2025. It is designed to be a rich, clean, and accessible resource for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and anime enthusiasts. The data captures a wide array of information for over 28,000 unique anime titles, providing a deep look into the trends, metadata, and community ratings of the anime world.”* The dataset was posted by Md Sazzad Siddique, the only author and collaborator for the dataset.
